## Project Overview

The **HBnB** application enables users to perform several key operations:
- Manage their user account.
- Create, list, and view place listings.
- Submit reviews for places they've visited.
- Manage amenities associated with places.

The project follows a **layered architecture** divided into three layers: **Presentation**, **Business Logic**, and **Persistence**. It emphasizes security, data validation, and error handling. User, place, and review data are stored in a relational database.

## Architecture

### Layered Architecture

The project is built using a **layered architecture**:
1. **Presentation Layer**: User interface through the API.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Manages the core operations for users, places, reviews, and amenities.
3. **Persistence Layer**: Handles database interactions via repositories like `UserRepository` and `PlaceRepository`.

The **Facade Pattern** simplifies interactions between the Presentation and Business Logic layers.

### Class Diagrams

The main entities in the system are:
- **User**: Handles registration, profile updates, and deletion.
- **Place**: Manages the creation, modification, and deletion of listings.
- **Review**: Allows users to create, update, and list reviews.
- **Amenity**: Manages amenities associated with places.

Each class includes attributes like `id`, `created_at`, and CRUD operations.

### Sequence Diagrams

The application follows a typical web-based architecture:
- The **user** interacts with the **API**, sending requests like `register()`, `createPlace()`, and `leaveReview()`.
- The API authenticates the user and forwards the request to the **Business Logic Layer**.
- The **Business Logic Layer** manages data validation and interacts with the database.
- Typical HTTP responses include:
  - **201**: Successful resource creation.
  - **200**: Successful data retrieval.
  - **409**: Data conflict.
  - **400**: Invalid request.
